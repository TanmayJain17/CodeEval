CodeEvaluator Logic 

===================Front End of the code ===================

Step 1:Get the code by encoding it to base 64 (machine readable)
Step 2:Then encrypt the code (cypher is given)
Step 3:Then pass/send/evaluate encrypted code (Code sent to the server)

===================Back End of the code ===================

Step 4:Since the code is encrypted so first decrypt it (cypher is given)
Step 5:Then decode the decrypted code 
Step 6:Then Run the code 
Step 7:res.send it
